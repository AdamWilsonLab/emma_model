The details are given in
\[@slingsby_near-real_2020;@wilson_climatic_2015\], but in short what we
do is estimate the age of a site by calculating the years since the last
fire. We then fit a curve to model the recovery of vegetation (measured
using NDVI) as a function of it‚Äôs age. For this we use a negative
exponential curve with the following form:

$$\\mu\_{i,t}=\\alpha_i+\\gamma_i\\Big(1-e^{-\\frac{age\_{i,t}}{\\lambda_i}}\\Big)$$

where *Œº*<sub>*i*,‚ÄÜ*t*</sub> is the expected NDVI for site *i* at time
*t*

The observed greenness *N**D**V**I*<sub>*i*,‚ÄÜ*t*</sub> is assumed to
follow a normal distribution with mean *Œº*<sub>*i*,‚ÄÜ*t*</sub>
*N**D**V**I*<sub>*i*,‚ÄÜ*t*</sub>‚ÄÑ‚àº‚ÄÑùí©(*Œº*<sub>*i*,‚ÄÜ*t*</sub>,‚ÄÜ*œÉ*<sub>)</sub>

An additional level models the parameters of the negative exponential
curve as a function of environmental variables. This means that sites
with similar environmental conditions should have similar recovery
curves. The full model also includes a sinusoidal term to capture
seasonal variation, but lets keep it simple here.

## ADVI

We have `age` in years, a plot identifier `pid`. the observed ndvi `nd`
and two plot level environmental variable `env1`, which is mean annual
precipitation, and `env2`, which is the summer maximum temperature.

Lets load up our Stan model which codes the model described above. This
is not a particularly clever or efficient way of coding the model, but
it is nice and readable and works fine on this example dataset

How long did that take?

``` r
model_fit$time()$total

# Spatial Predictions

This section is not yet working - need to get the coordinates in the
original data set.

``` r
stan_spatial <- posterior_summary %>% 
  left_join(data,by="cellID") %>% #pid=gsub("[]]","",gsub(".*[[]","",variable))) %>% 
  select(cellID,x,y,date, age,ndvi,mean,q5,q95)


# pred_rast <- foreach(t=sort(unique(stan_spatial$date)),.combine=stack) %do% {
#   stan_spatial %>% 
#     filter(date==t) %>%
#     select(x,y,age,nd,mean,q5) %>% 
#     rasterFromXYZ()
# }

stan_spatial %>% 
  filter(date<as_date("2004-01-01")) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x=x,y=y,fill=mean))+
    geom_tile()+
    facet_wrap(~date)+
  coord_sf()
```
